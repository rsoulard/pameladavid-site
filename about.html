        <p class="statement-md">Clinton Township is my home. It has been for 30 years. My husband and I are raising our
            two precious boys here. For the past 15 years, I've devoted my career to educating children with special
            needs
            in our community.</p>
        <p class="statement-md">I am running to serve as your County Commissioner. In any other year, I would be out
            knocking on doors and getting to know you and the issues important to your family. While that's not possible
            at
            the moment, I hope to find other ways for us to communicate. This election is critical for Macomb County's
            future.</p>
        <p class="statement-md">My colleagues put their faith in me to represent them as the Vice President of our
            teacher's union, where I negotiated increased benefits for our teachers. You can always count on me to work
            tirelessly to deliver results for this community.</p>
        <p class="statement-md">Now more than ever, we need thoughtful and compassionate leadership to guide us through
            the
            coming months. Our residents and businesses are hurting. Our lives have been turned upside down.</p>
        <p class="statement-md">We know significant challenges lie ahead. While we take steps to return to normalcy, we
            need an eye to the future. Infrastructure, education, and enhancing public safety should be our guiding
            investments.</p>
        <p class="statement-md">I'm a teacher. Teachers shape the future. I am asking for your vote so that together, we
            can continue to move Clinton Township forward through these very difficult times.</p>

    <p class="statement text-center">It would be an honor to serve you.</p>
